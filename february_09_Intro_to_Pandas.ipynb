At the end of the day, you *are* doing science - you are using empirical observations to test hypotheses (and occasionally, to predict the future based on these hypotheses). Therefore, it is important to follow the same principles that guide scientific inquiry. These are in use far beyond academia. Regardless of where you work, whether a tech firm, bank, non-profit, or research institution, your analytical work **must** be:\n",
        "1. Well-documented\n",
        "2. Conscientious in reducing bias (the same way we randomize trials and only collect the data we need to answer a specific question, we have to make sure our data are clean, examined for potential bias, and are suited to the question we want to answer)\n",
        "2. Reproducible (commenting and code sharing are crucial)\n",
        "3. Responsibly and clearly communicated (you've done all the work, and now it's important to get it out in the world! Communicating the results of data analyses can be very difficult, especially to folks who don't have a background in it. It is your responsibility to do the best you can in stating what your research can and can't answer, and to make sure that any communication about the data comes from the data - don't make unfounded leaps, or allow others to)\n",
