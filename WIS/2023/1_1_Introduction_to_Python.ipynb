        "There's a lot we didn't do in this module. We didn't use a single `import` statement, meaning we only used built-in Python code. There's a lot we skipped, most notably error checking and dealing with errors. Python is pretty good at describing errors, but it's annoying to write code that causes them intentionally. Better to have them arise organically in a group of beginners.\n",

        "At the same time, it's important to underscore that, outside of list comprehensions and other things like dunder methods, everything here is quickly portable to other languages. It's the concepts that matter, and it's the concepts that will occupy your imagination."
