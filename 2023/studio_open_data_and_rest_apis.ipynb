        "\n",
        "“API” stands for “[Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API),” and it can often be used somewhat imprecisely. As an interface, it means precisely that it is the means by which something (typically a computer program) can access or use an “application.” \n",
        "\n",
        "One way of thinking about this is about the lock on your apartment door. The lock exposes an interface that allows something else to lock or unlock the lock, typically a key. Furthermore, that interface is typically “documented” in some way, meaning that a user can fashion their key following the documentation and thereby lock and unlock the door. The documentation can describe the pattern of teeth and grooves for a mechanical lock, or the number required for a numpad lock, or the particular encoding needed for a keycard lock. \n",
        "\n",
        "The door lock has one input (the key), and it can then lock or unlock, so the interface is rather straight forward. Furthermore, the user of the lock does not have to understand exactly what the lock’s mechanism is. They simply need to know that if they use the key in a certain way, the lock will either lock or unlock. This lets the creator of the lock only “expose” the necessary components of the lock to the user and “obscure” the internal details, about which the user probably doesn’t care too much. \n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, I don’t know (or need to know) how the lock to my apartment works. I just know that the key I have will unlock and lock it, though sometimes I need to jiggle it a bit since the interface isn’t perfect!\n",
        "\n",
        "APIs for computer programs can be far more complex than a lock, but the idea is the same: there exist a finite number of means by which a user can interact with the computer program, and those means tend to be documented, so programmers can use the programs predictably; they can be confident that a certain set of inputs will generate the outputs they want. The internal details are not  important to the user/programmer.\n",

        "\n",
        "APIs are widespread in software engineering, but often people will use the term a bit imprecisely to refer specifically to “[Web APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API),” what I am calling “REST or REST-like APIs.” The Web API is still a documented set of inputs made available to the user/programmer, but the difference is that the user/programmer typically interacts with the application over the Web, using different forms of URLs to access different parts of the API. \n",
        "\n",
        "Web APIs make it possible for websites to effectively talk to each other. You could hypothetically make a personal homepage that uses [Twitter’s API](https://developer.twitter.com/en) to load your ten most recent Tweets on one part of your webpage, [Reddit’s API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) to load your Reddit profile on another part of your webpage, and [Facebook’s Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) to load information from your Facebook in another part of your webpage.\n",
        "\n",
        "What’s more, you can often use APIs not only to `GET` information ([`GET` is a “verb” that is part of the http protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET), but also [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) new information. It’s via Twitter’s Web API that many Twitter bots are able to post “automatically.” They don’t click on a webpage and type in a message; they build a payload and `POST` that payload to the API, which creates a Tweet.\n",
        "\n",
        "[REST APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) are a specific type of Web API that rely on specific principles and constraints to make the API somewhat predictable; if you know a Web API is a REST API, you can save on reading some documentation! RESTful APIs can be very useful when designing your own web application, and popular web frameworks often have built-in logic for creating or interacting with RESTful APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Though “REST” is in the title of this notebook and the Web API we will be using, [The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/), presents itself as RESTful, there won’t be any more discussion of REST!"

We can feed the API search terms and get data about the 470k+ artworks in The Met’s collection. \n",

This obviates the need for the API, since with the download, we can query it however we want to, without needing to use the API’s specific points of entry. Of course, loading a 300MB spreadsheet into Excel may not be a lot of fun.\n",
        "\n",
        "We’ll be using two specific “endpoints” for our API access, the search endpoint, which lets us query the collection, and the object endpoint, which lets us get data about specific objects.

The first constant is the URL for The Met’s API. The second constant is how long to wait between API calls. Typically, there is a limit on how many API calls one can make in a certain period of time. For The Met, it’s 80 calls per second, so we’ll tell Python to wait $\\frac{1}{80}$ of a second between each call. We need to import the Time library to tell Python to sleep."

We can start doing some like exploratory data analysis on our results.
