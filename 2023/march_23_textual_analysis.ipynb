        "\n",
        "A corpus of text can come ready-made or it has to be collected by the researcher through a process that often calls for a certain amount of creativity. The Libraries’ [Guide on Text Mining](https://guides.library.columbia.edu/text-mining) includes a few resources for finding both free and licensed corpora. But often a ready-made corpus fits the needs of a researcher looking to improve an algorithm, not a researcher looking to glean information from the content of the corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this latter case, the researcher has to build the corpus. If the text is online, there are usually three ways to do this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Access the Site’s Database**: This is probably the easiest solution, but it’s also the least likely. Still, it probably does not hurt to reach out to the admin of a site you want to mine and ask for either a dump of their content or read access to their database. But, again, this is unlikely.\n",
        "1. **Access via the Site’s API**: If the site has a [REST API](https://restfulapi.net/) or similar, then it’s often possible to interact with the site programmatically to get the site’s content. For example, historically both [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) have had friendly APIs in the past that have since been somewhat curtailed. Twitter’s API is still rather open for academic researchers, but, of course, in March 2023, it’s hard to tell what’s exactly going on on Twitter. With Reddit, historical access to the content of posts seems no longer possible, but there are external tools like [PushShift](https://pushshift.io/) that can help.\n",
        "1. **Scrape the Site**: This is the technique we will be using. This is the **WORST OPTION** for two reasons: it’s the finickiest, as what works today might not work in the future with no prior warning, and, second, websites often **EXPLICITLY FORBID** scraping. This forbidding is often listed on the site’s `robots.txt` file, which tells webcrawlers if they are allowed to crawl the site and which parts are crawlable. However, sometimes, like in [Facebook’s `robots.txt` file](https://facebook.com/robots.txt), the limitations are spelled out in clear language.\n",
