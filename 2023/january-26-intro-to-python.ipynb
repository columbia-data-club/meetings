        "  * General instruction to teach insights into programming\n",

        "* Abstractly, programming languages are not different from each other. Almost all of them are “[Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness),” meaning they can all be used to solve the same set of problems. As such, skills you learn on any programming language will carry over into Python.\n",
        "* Nevertheless there are two good reasons to start your programming career with Python:\n",
        "  1. Python is allegedly easy and has rather human-readable code\n",
        "  2.

There's a lot we skipped, most notably error checking and dealing with errors. Python is pretty good at describing errors, but it's annoying to write code that causes them intentionally. Better to have them arise organically in a group of beginners. \n",
        "\n",
        "At intermediate levels, you can start [handling the errors](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html). If we tried to create a `NinjaTurtle` with a height of \"🥰,\" Python would let us, but when we tried to calculate that turtle's BMI, the program would crash, because you can't multiply \"🥰\" times itself. You also can't convert \"🥰\" to inches. A more robust class definition would check to make sure that the value given for height is a number, for example, and raise an exception that alerts us that \"A `NinjaTurtle`'s `height` must be represented by a number.\"\n",
