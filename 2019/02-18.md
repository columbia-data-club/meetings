# Inaugural meeting

## Kang presented on Git and topic modeling

* TED-IUM was the software Kang used to convert audio to text, or something
like that.

## Xiaoxi presented on sentiment analysis

* The initial work was done on
[HappyDB](https://github.com/rit-public/HappyDB), a “gold standard” corpus of
natural examples of language describing happiness.

* Next the HappyDB was compared to the [_Guardian_
corpus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813042109).

* Next, Xiaoxi aimed to see if there was a correlation between “happiness” in
HappyDB and the [NRC sentiment
lexicon](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm).

## Haoyu presented on a Twitter/MTA project

* Haoyu used a pre-built dataset of tweets from MTA

* Then analyzed them to see when delays and service interruptions were
happening.

## Yiming presented on machine learning

* Yiming compared linear and ensemble algorithms.

* The work is available in a [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/taniesta/comparison-between-linear-ensemble-learning)

* The interest in the different algorithms interested the audience

## NEXT MEETING:

* Xiaoxi will present on different machine learning algorithms, including
random forest and gradient boosting, and we’ll try to see what algorithms work
best when.
