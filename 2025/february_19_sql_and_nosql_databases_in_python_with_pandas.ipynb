        "## What Are SQL and NoSQL?\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we can begin with what is a database before distinguishing between these two paradigms. Simply, but perhaps unhelpfully, a database is a collection of data where the data are queryable (read: findable) in some fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### SQL (Structured Query Language)\n",
        "\n",
        "[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is a very common language used to query a database. It is older than I am and has been battle tested in much the same way. The language stands in for a kind of paradigm for organizing data, namely into relational databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a relational database, an point of data (a datum) is stored as a row in a table, with properties pertaining to that datum as columns. What makes the database relational is having multiple tables that are linked to each other, so you can have one table for customers, one for orders, and one for products. That way, the entry in the orders table includes a column linking to the appropriate row in the customers table and (this is a simplication) every item in the order links to the appropriate item in the products table.\n",
        "\n",
        "This structure allows for very fine grained querying, like “show me the ZIP code of every customer who ordered a TK-421 widget in the past three weeks.” This involves hitting all three tables: the products table to find the TK-421 widget, the orders table to find orders in the past three weeks that included the widget, and then the customers table to look up the ZIP codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, this is kind of _easy_ to do in SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL and relational databases also have a rigid structure and transaction model to ensure that “ACID” is maintained. [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) ensures that databases are in the correct state even if there are power failures or other catastrophes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### NoSQL (These Days: “Not only SQL”)\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) databases basically cover everything else. Relaxing a bit on the rigid structures of SQL databases, NoSQL databases can be more flexible at the cost of some reliability. They also work great with data that come in with unpredictable structures and can even pretend to be regular relational databases if you like.\n",
        "\n",
        "NoSQL databases these days come in basically three flavors: [key-value stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database), [graph databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database), and document stores. We’ll be looking at the latter.\n",
        "\n",
        "A [document store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database) replaces the metaphor of a row in a table linked to rows in other tables with the metaphor of a document in a box of other documents. Some documents might have drawings on them and some might have a receipt stapled to them. The database doesn’t care. It simply indexes whatever comes in and makes the document available for searching later.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, it’s not quite as chaotic as that, but it’s not far off the mark. Typically a document looks somewhat like an object in JavaScript or a dictionary in Python or, well, an XML document. That is, the document has a bunch of properties (keys or tags) that also have values. No two documents in a datastore have to have the same properties, though it is helpful to have _some_ structure to aid in searching.\n",
        "\n",
        "The loosened ACID requirements on NoSQL make a lot of the Internet possible, because users are able to make changes to a database (like rank a movie in Netflix or post something on Facebook), and the action can happen instantly, with it trickling through the datastores to eventually be consistent. With an SQL database, every like of a movie or post on Facebook would lock up the database server until it could guarantee that the transaction had completed. (Again, an oversimplication, but it's basically right.)"

On the other hand, we can say that systems like contemporary social media would be next to impossible without NoSQL databases, because of their flexibility and responsiveness.\n",
