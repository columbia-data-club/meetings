        "1. **Shapefile** Created by Esri, the company behind ArcGIS, [shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) are an established vector format. Every shapefile is actually a combination of files, including one that ends in `*.shp`, which are often bundled together as a `.zip`. GeoPandas can read them even as `.zip` files without unbundling.\n",
        "2. **GeoJSON** A comparative newcomer to geospatial data encoding, [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) encodes all of the data into a giant, plain text file formatted as JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation. As such, every GeoJSON data file is also a valid JavaScript object. With only one file, GeoJSON is somewhat more portable than shapefiles, and the file format is especially web-friendly.\n",
